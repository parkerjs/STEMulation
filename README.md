# STEMulation
A framework that facilitates development of mathematical models and simulations.

This project represents an object-oriented C++ library that employs a combination of factory, template method, adapter, composite, strategy, and observer design patterns to facilitate development of simulations based in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). A notable feature of the library includes a set of attribute classes that allow derived classes to implement increasing capability through interface inheritance. The framework includes tools to perform control systems analysis (includes bode plots, frequency response via time-domain models), system identification, root-finding, eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis, Gaussian quadrature/numerical integration, numerical differentiation (including partial derivatives), matrix operations, multi-dimensional interpolation, numerical differential equation solving (Adaptive Runge-Kutta techniques), Fourier analysis (FFT), FIR Filtering, and numerical optimization (linear and non-linear). The library also includes a messaging library for simulating network communication. This library is a work in progess!
